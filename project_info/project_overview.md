#Project Overview
I am building a web application called Reggie that is a software product that will speed up workflows in the education admin space.
This is the front end of the application to be built in NextJS.
You will be using NextJS, as well as shadcn, tailwind, and lucid icon.
The backend is in python and it will handle all complex logic and database interactions.

If there is specific API documentation you need to complete a task, please ask for it instead of guessing.
